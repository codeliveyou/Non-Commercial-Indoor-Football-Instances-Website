1. File List
   A. Filename: instances/InputX.txt
      Short description:
		First line gives the total number of days in the season.
		Second line gives the total number of teams in the league.
		From the third line on, team availabilities are given.
      Each column represents a team, each row represents a slot. A "1" means that the slot is in the home game set of the team; a "2" means the slot is in the forbidden game set; "0" means that the team can play an away match. 
   B. Filename: calendars_opt/calendarX.txt
      Short description:
      Optimal calendars generated with the Gurobi software.
      Each row i represents the home team, each column j represents the away team. The cell (i,j) stores the slot in which home team i plays against away team j.
      A "-1" indicates that the match could not be scheduled.

        
   C. Filename: calendars_tabu/calendar_X_Y.txt
      Short description:
      Calendars generated by our tabu search based heuristic. 
      X represents the instance, Y represents the run (in total we performed 100 runs for each instance).
      The format of the calendar is the same as in item B.
